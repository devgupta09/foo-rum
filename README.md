# Foo-rum: Social Feed App

A simple social feed application built with **React**, **TypeScript**, **Vite**, and the Context API. This app demonstrates authentication, protected routes, posting to a feed, and modern React best practicesâ€”all without third-party state management libraries.

## Features

- Authentication modal (Sign In / Sign Up)
- Protected routes using React Router
- Add new posts to a global feed
- Random user and emoji assignment for each post
- Responsive and accessible UI
- Context API for global state (auth, feed, modal)
- Code-splitting with React.lazy and Suspense

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+ recommended)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### Running the App

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.
